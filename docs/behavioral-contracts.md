# Behavioral Contracts

Parent index: [Documentation index](INDEX.md)

## Purpose

This document maps critical current behavioral invariants to focused tests and smoke verification.

## Overview

The matrix covers implemented behavior. Future cross-database restore and concurrency contracts remain explicit future requirements.

## Contract matrix

| Contract | Protection |
| --- | --- |
| Default local config saves/reopens with Reliquary magic and typed defaults | `config_tests::default_config_saves_and_reopens` |
| Config replacement keeps only current objects and does not grow from history | `config_tests::replacing_config_does_not_accumulate_old_objects` |
| Unknown future config objects survive known-object replacement | `config_tests::unknown_objects_survive_known_config_replacement` |
| Invalid config is rejected before replacing the existing file | `config_tests::invalid_values_do_not_replace_existing_config` |
| Switchboard provider auth/capabilities are explicit | `model_switchboard_tests::provider_auth_and_capabilities_are_explicit` |
| Insomnia ownership route policy prefers metadata and falls back to main Insomnia inside the library switchboard | `model_switchboard_tests::insomnia_ownership_prefers_metadata_then_main` |
| Long-lived runtime routes keep Insomnia, metadata/ownership, Dream, and Embedding capabilities distinct and apply hosted fallback inside Reliquary | `runtime_host_route_tests::runtime_routes_keep_inference_capabilities_separate`, `runtime_host_route_tests::runtime_routes_apply_fallbacks_inside_reliquary` |
| CLI production modules do not reconstruct configured runtime composition or retrieval candidate policy | `reliquary-cli` `boundary_tests::cli_does_not_own_runtime_composition_or_retrieval_policy` |
| General/embedding routes and encrypted credentials round-trip together; route removal remains current-state replacement | `model_switchboard_tests::routes_and_credentials_round_trip_and_attach_auth_headers`, `model_switchboard_tests::clearing_model_routes_removes_them_from_current_config` |
| Unsupported provider routes plus missing/wrong-kind credentials are rejected | `model_switchboard_tests::invalid_provider_routes_are_rejected`, `model_switchboard_tests::missing_or_wrong_credential_kind_is_rejected` |
| OpenAI-ready and Codex credentials resolve to bearer auth; Codex also attaches ChatGPT account ID when present | `model_switchboard_tests::routes_and_credentials_round_trip_and_attach_auth_headers` |
| Credential plaintext never appears in `reliquary.cfg` and encrypted credentials round-trip | `credential_tests::encrypted_credentials_round_trip_without_plaintext_in_config` |
| Wrong master keys and ciphertext tampering fail authenticated decryption | `credential_tests::wrong_master_key_cannot_decrypt_credentials`, `credential_tests::authenticated_encryption_rejects_tampering` |
| Clearing credentials removes encrypted credential objects rather than accumulating history | `credential_tests::clearing_credentials_removes_encrypted_objects` |
| Master key is generated once from OS entropy and remains stable across reloads | `master_key_tests::json_store_generates_and_reloads_one_stable_key` |
| Independent key stores produce different keys and debug output redacts key material | `master_key_tests::separately_created_stores_get_different_keys`, `master_key_tests::debug_output_never_contains_key_material` |
| `ReliquaryConfig` places the temporary JSON master key beside the config | `config_tests::config_creates_temporary_master_key_beside_itself` |
| Current typed REL/PHY headers persist a durable UUID and derive canonical owner IDs from scope/type plus UUID | `reliquary_tests::new_reliquary_is_typed_project_rel`, `reliquary_tests::reliquary_scope_kind_roundtrips`, `phylactery_tests::*` |
| Reliquary comparison requires the same durable owner ID and distinguishes identical, one-side-ahead, and divergent physical histories | `cva_reconcile_tests::compare_identical_copies`, `cva_reconcile_tests::compare_detects_one_side_ahead`, `cva_reconcile_tests::compare_detects_divergent_tails`, `cva_reconcile_tests::compare_rejects_different_owners` |
| Divergent CVA reconciliation repacks Archive source state, interaction-stream checkpoints, Episodes/Fragments, Memory revisions, Graph relationship transactions, durable Insomnia completions, file-to-Memory links, and compatibility profiles into a fresh CVA; Graph replays after Memories with fresh clocks, grouped completions are re-ticketed, lexical/topology derived state rebuilds, stale vector state is retired, and incompatible stream/Branch/Memory/completion/Graph histories fail closed | `cva_reconcile_tests::divergent_reconcile_preserves_interrupted_interaction_streams`, `cva_reconcile_merge_tests::*`, `cva_reconcile_memory_tests::*`, `cva_reconcile_graph_tests::*`, `cva_reconcile_grouped_tests::reconcile_replays_grouped_insomnia_memory_records`, `cva_reconcile_link_tests::reconcile_replays_file_memory_links_after_targets`, `cva_reconcile_guard_tests::*`, `cva_reconcile_derived_tests::reconcile_repacks_fragments_and_retires_stale_vector_state` |
| Known semantic reconciliation collisions surface as public structured `CvaReconcileConflict` values with stable kinds and owner identity/details instead of raw Archive/Memory/Graph/Insomnia errors | `cva_reconcile_conflict_tests::source_turn_conflict_exposes_stable_kind_and_identity`, `cva_reconcile_conflict_tests::memory_mutation_conflict_exposes_mutation_identity`, `cva_reconcile_merge_tests::reconcile_surfaces_conflicting_branch_revisions`, `cva_reconcile_memory_tests::reconcile_surfaces_conflicting_memory_revisions`, `cva_reconcile_guard_tests::reconcile_refuses_conflicting_insomnia_completions` |
| Re-presenting an already absorbed Graph-bearing conflicted copy is a semantic no-op and preserves the canonical bytes without reconciliation receipts | `cva_reconcile_graph_tests::absorbed_graph_copy_is_semantic_noop` |
| Owner-local Leiden refresh partitions current Graph nodes through deterministic graph-local scan shards and a bounded parallel binary merge reduction, carries cross-shard structural evidence forward as weighted coarse edges, is worker-count deterministic and byte-idempotent while Graph is unchanged, becomes stale after Graph mutation, reopens independently in REL/PHY, and requires durable owner identity | `community_tests::*`, `community_scan_merge_tests::*` |
| Owner-local Memory retrieval uses the validated production Community sub-centroids, always preserves an unclustered vector residual lane, keeps an explicit/global fallback path, rejects stale cached indexes after Graph changes or selected-profile Memory-vector additions, works independently in REL/PHY, and lets Community locality break ties only within equal Graph depth | `memory_retrieval_tests::rel_retrieval_routes_current_communities_and_falls_back_without_them`, `memory_retrieval_stale_tests::cached_index_rejects_vector_population_changes_without_memory_mutation`, `memory_retrieval_tests::phylactery_retrieval_uses_owner_local_community_routing`, `memory_retrieval_tests::community_traversal_prefers_same_region_only_within_equal_depth` |
| Safe promotion validates/syncs a sibling reconciliation candidate before atomically replacing the canonical CVA, preserves the conflicted source, cleans temporary artifacts, and leaves the canonical bytes unchanged when reconciliation fails | `cva_reconcile_promotion_tests::reconcile_and_promote_replaces_canonical_after_validation`, `cva_reconcile_promotion_tests::failed_reconciliation_never_changes_canonical`, `cva_reconcile_promotion_tests::promotion_rejects_the_same_physical_file` |

| Current branch inventory exposes only the latest branch revision after reopen | `archive_inventory_tests::current_branch_inventory_exposes_latest_revision_after_reopen` |
| Derived conversation inventory survives reopen, exposes every durable leaf, and resolves only an explicitly selected ancestry path | `conversation_tests::conversation_summary_and_path_survive_reopen`, `conversation_tests::conversation_summary_exposes_multiple_durable_leaves` |
| Live conversation search derives default Fragment windows transiently over only the selected root-to-leaf ancestry, includes a fresh unfragmented tail, excludes sibling branches, and advances no Archive/Fragment state | `conversation_search_tests::branch_search_is_transient_and_excludes_sibling_branch`, `conversation_search_tests::branch_search_includes_fresh_unfragmented_tail`, `conversation_search_tests::branch_search_validates_query_limit_and_leaf` |
| Existing branch heads cannot jump backward to an ancestor | `history_tests::existing_branch_head_cannot_jump_backwards` |
| An old conversation point can seed a new local branch without Archive rollback | `history_tests::old_conversation_point_can_start_a_new_local_branch` |
| Shared prefixes/content bodies deduplicate | `archive_tests::shared_branch_prefix_and_content_are_stored_once` |
| Identical node append is idempotent | `archive_tests::identical_node_append_is_idempotent` |
| Unversioned semantic payloads remain inert on reopen | `archive_tests::unversioned_semantic_record_is_inert_on_reopen` |
| Standalone embedded files round-trip arbitrary bytes, deduplicate identical content, and preserve distinct manifest identity | `file_tests::files_round_trip_and_share_content_objects` |
| Filename search is incremental/reopenable and does not search file contents | `file_tests::filename_search_is_incremental_reopenable_and_does_not_search_file_contents` |
| Project revision correlations persist exact Lore/Git repository identity/revision plus management policy without consuming semantic clocks, require stable repository identity, and survive reopen/reconciliation under prefix-compatible history | `project_history_tests::*`, `project_history_reconcile_tests::*` |
| Repository-backed Project attachments persist immutable `FileId -> ProjectFileRef` bindings, reject conflicting rebinding/out-of-subtree paths, preserve historical revision identity, and omit duplicate payload bytes from REL | `project_file_attachment_tests::*` |
| Echo events persist as ordered turn-attached execution evidence, replay idempotently, reject sequence conflicts, and survive reopen/import/reconciliation without becoming Archive/Memory authority | `echo_tests::*`, migration/reconciliation Echo coverage |
| One turn ingestion publishes the source node, attached file manifests, and native source provenance together under one Archive mutation | `turn_ingest_tests::turn_ingestion_publishes_node_and_attachments_together` |
| Repeated identical turn ingestion is idempotent while attachment drift conflicts | `turn_ingest_tests::turn_ingestion_is_idempotent_and_rejects_attachment_drift` |
| Unversioned native turn-ingestion records are inert after reopen | `turn_ingest_tests::unversioned_ingested_turn_is_inert_on_reopen` |

| Replayed normalized turns remain idempotent at the runtime boundary | `interaction_runtime_tests::replayed_normalized_turn_is_idempotent` |
| Normalized agent role maps to the stable Archive assistant role rather than preserving transport vocabulary | `interaction_runtime_tests::normalized_agent_role_maps_to_archive_assistant_role` |
| Plain `append_text` assembly remains runtime-only until publication, while explicit assistant checkpoints can durably preserve cumulative visible text without creating Archive source authority | `interaction_session_tests::streamed_message_assembles_before_one_durable_publication`, `interaction_runtime_tests::checkpointed_stream_survives_reopen_as_interrupted` |
| Existing durable sessions require an explicit valid resume message and the next completed message chains from that leaf | `interaction_session_tests::session_chains_messages_and_resumes_from_durable_leaf_after_reopen` |
| Cancelled or incomplete runtime streams never become Archive source history; a synchronized checkpoint instead reopens as interrupted transcript evidence | `interaction_session_tests::incomplete_or_cancelled_stream_never_becomes_source_history`, `interaction_runtime_tests::checkpointed_stream_survives_reopen_as_interrupted` |
| Successful completion of a checkpointed assistant message publishes the same stable message ID into Archive and suppresses the journal copy from transcript resolution | `interaction_runtime_tests::completed_stream_replaces_checkpoint_without_duplicate_transcript_turn` |
| Live Episode scheduling occurs only after source acknowledgement and can finalize/queue the durable session path independently | `interaction_session_tests::live_episode_scheduling_is_explicitly_after_turn_acknowledgement` |
| A live completion preserves its durable source receipt even when the subsequent scheduling attempt fails | `interaction_session_tests::live_completion_preserves_durable_receipt_when_scheduling_fails` |

| Fragment windows/tails remain append-only and branch-neutral; the default window policy is library-owned and reused by adapters | `fragment_tests::*`, `config_tests::default_config_saves_and_reopens` |
| Packed-vector matrices round-trip beside Archive data in one CVA | `packed_vector_tests::packed_vectors_round_trip_inside_same_cva_as_archive` |
| Equal packed matrices deduplicate by schema+bytes | `packed_vector_tests::identical_packed_matrix_is_content_addressed_once` |
| Raw packed-vector backing objects consume no semantic clock | `packed_vector_tests::raw_packed_vectors_do_not_advance_semantic_clocks` |

| Archive Vectors preserve exact row-to-FragmentId order across reopen | `archive_vector_tests::archive_vectors_bind_rows_to_fragments_and_round_trip` |
| Equal Archive-Vector bindings deduplicate by matrix ID + ordered fragments | `archive_vector_tests::identical_archive_vector_binding_is_content_addressed_once` |
| Archive Vectors require an existing matrix and exact row count | `archive_vector_tests::binding_requires_existing_matrix_and_exact_row_count` |
| Archive Vector mappings require real unique fragments | `archive_vector_tests::binding_requires_real_unique_fragments` |
| Archive Vector backing objects consume no semantic clock | `archive_vector_tests::archive_vector_objects_do_not_advance_semantic_clocks` |
| Corrupt Archive Vector mappings are rejected on reopen | `archive_vector_tests::corrupt_archive_vector_mapping_is_rejected_on_reopen` |
| Compatibility Profiles round-trip and consume no semantic clock | `compatibility_profile_tests::profile_round_trips_and_is_clock_neutral` |
| Small numerical drift remains compatible and reuses the existing profile | `compatibility_profile_tests::tiny_endpoint_drift_is_compatible_and_reuses_profile` |
| Materially different endpoint behavior creates a distinct compatibility profile | `compatibility_profile_tests::materially_different_endpoint_gets_a_distinct_profile` |
| Dimension mismatch is incompatible before vector comparison | `compatibility_profile_tests::dimensions_are_part_of_compatibility` |
| Simulated endpoint builds/reopens an active vector generation | `vector_generation_tests::simulated_endpoint_builds_and_reopens_active_generation` |
| Rebuilding unchanged profile/Archive population is idempotent | `vector_generation_tests::repeated_build_is_idempotent` |
| Newer Archive cuts supersede only that profile's current generation | `vector_generation_tests::newer_archive_cut_supersedes_compatibility_profile_generation` |
| Different compatibility profiles retain independent current generations | `vector_generation_tests::compatibility_profiles_keep_independent_active_generations` |
| Small compatible endpoint drift can build under an existing profile | `vector_generation_tests::compatible_endpoint_drift_can_build_under_existing_profile` |
| Incompatible endpoint behavior cannot build under a profile | `vector_generation_tests::incompatible_endpoint_cannot_build_under_profile` |
| Profile/packed dimensions must match | `vector_generation_validation_tests::publication_rejects_profile_matrix_dimension_mismatch` |
| Published generations reject non-`f32` matrices until alternate scalar semantics exist | `vector_generation_validation_tests::publication_rejects_non_f32_generation_matrix` |
| Generation source cut must cover every mapped fragment | `vector_generation_validation_tests::publication_rejects_source_before_mapped_fragments` |
| One global version cannot be claimed by both Archive and Vector Generations | `vector_generation_validation_tests::reopen_rejects_global_version_claimed_by_archive_and_vectors` |
| Unversioned generation payloads are inert | `vector_generation_validation_tests::unversioned_generation_payload_is_inert_on_reopen` |
| Exact semantic search verifies compatibility, uses Query mode, ranks by cosine, drops non-positive scores, advances no semantic clock, and survives reopen | `semantic_search_tests::semantic_search_exactly_ranks_current_generation_and_reopens` |
| Semantic search resolves the newest generation for the selected profile | `semantic_search_tests::semantic_search_uses_newest_generation_for_profile` |
| Semantic search rejects missing generations, empty/invalid limits, and incompatible endpoints | `semantic_search_tests::semantic_search_rejects_invalid_requests_and_incompatible_endpoint` |
| Default search restores `0.45/0.55` fusion, 30 candidates, 10 results, undiluted single-channel scores, and accepts explicit validated retrieval policy | `search_policy_tests::old_default_weights_and_limits_are_restored`, `search_tests::hybrid_search_preserves_single_channel_scores_and_blends_shared_hits`, `search_tests::duplicate_ranges_are_removed_and_default_result_limit_is_ten` |
| Lexical scoring preserves the original coverage+density formula | `search_policy_tests::lexical_scoring_matches_original_coverage_density_formula` |
| Same-conversation overlapping ranges are diversified | `search_tests::diversification_penalizes_overlapping_ranges_from_same_conversation` |
| Duplicate ranges are removed and default output is capped at 10 | `search_tests::duplicate_ranges_are_removed_and_default_result_limit_is_ten` |
| Dream candidate discovery reuses stored Memory vectors, preserves a source-timestamp prior quota, deterministically fuses semantic/lexical/temporal lanes, permits lexical or temporal fallback for unvectorized active Memories, excludes archived Memories, and attaches same-owner active Graph plus temporal context in either REL or PHY | `dream_candidate_tests::*`, `dream_temporal_tests::*`, `phylactery_dream_tests::phy_dream_candidates_and_temporal_analysis_need_no_archive` |
| Dream temporal analysis resolves explicit and relative content time deterministically from Memory body + authoritative source time, ignores Memory creation bookkeeping, preserves recurrence identity, and retrieves temporal-only candidates without model calls | `dream_temporal_tests::*` |
| Dream pair classification canonicalizes A/B by MemoryId independent of processing direction, requires strict relation/direction compatibility and verbatim evidence from both Memories, evaluates only the bounded candidate set, and writes no semantic state | `dream_classifier_tests::*` |
| Dream verification reuses the same canonical pair, independently checks relation/direction/evidence with categorical yes/no/uncertain signals, deterministically derives accept/reject/uncertain, defaults to duplicate/supersedes only, and writes no semantic state | `dream_verifier_tests::*` |
| Dream publication reconciles primary pair state in one Graph transaction, persists topical/recurrent symmetrically, preserves factual/causal/supersedes direction, honors verifier gating, and leaves structural/reference edges alone | `dream_publisher_tests::*`, `graph_tests::relation_batch_*` |
| Verified duplicate publication maintains a source-time-ordered `newer → previous equivalent` chain with a derived graph-versioned B-tree index, is insertion-order independent, atomically rewires middle/merged chains, rejects missing source time, and ignores Memory creation bookkeeping | `dream_duplicate_tests::*` |
| Dream lifecycle advances successfully completed active `extracted` sources to `knowledge` unless stronger canonical evidence applies, conservatively archives redundant extracted duplicates, projects verified supersession into archival/`superseded_by`, promotes direct/correction authoritative current-state classes, and inherits canonical status through a unique verified superseder. REL additionally requires distinct authority anchors for corroboration; PHY deliberately does not invent a source-independent substitute | `dream_lifecycle_tests::*`, `dream_canonical_tests::*`, `phylactery_dream_tests::phy_lifecycle_does_not_invent_provenance_based_corroboration` |
| The bounded Dream processor composes candidate retrieval → classification → required verification → same-owner Graph publication/duplicate handling → lifecycle completion for either REL or PHY; inference failure leaves the source lifecycle unchanged, and PHY processing requires no Archive | `dream_processor_tests::*`, `phylactery_dream_tests::phy_dream_processor_publishes_duplicate_chain_and_archives_only_in_phy` |
| The shared `InteractionRuntime` background coordinator drains Insomnia and Memory-vector work before Dream, derives Dream backlog from active `extracted` Memories instead of a second durable queue, does not requeue completed lifecycle work, and isolates one Dream inference failure from later pending Memories in the same bounded cycle | `interaction_background_tests::*` |
| Dedicated Dream model routing is independently configurable and falls back to General when absent | `model_switchboard_tests::dream_route_falls_back_to_general_when_unset`, `model_switchboard_tests::configured_dream_endpoint_uses_dedicated_route`, CLI `args_tests::dream_model_route_is_configurable` |
| OpenAI-compatible Dream structured inference forces exactly one requested function/tool call and parses only its JSON arguments; wrong names, missing/multiple calls, or malformed arguments are rejected | `openai_ready_general_tests::forced_tool_result_requires_exact_named_single_call`, `openai_ready_general_tests::forced_tool_result_rejects_wrong_name_or_multiple_calls` |
| Prepared corpus round-trips branches/content/fragments | `examples/archive_roundtrip.rs` |
| Insomnia structured extraction requires explicit candidate authority kind (`direct`/`correction`/`adoption`/`retention`) and persists it through candidate parsing into authoritative Memory revisions; legacy R2 Memories reopen with `unknown` rather than inferred authority | `insomnia::extraction_tests::authority_kind_is_required_and_preserved_by_structured_extraction`, `insomnia::worker_vector_tests::backlog_drain_automatically_vectorizes_created_memories`, `memory_codec_tests::*` |
| Insomnia deterministic authority policy distinguishes assistant authority provenance from referent grounding, rejects invalid authority/provenance combinations and unsupported vague/question authority, and preserves user-owned corrections such as ShipStats when grounding resolves only the referent | `insomnia::candidate_policy_tests::*`, `insomnia::grounding_tests::correction_can_use_grounding_without_adopting_assistant_authority` |
| Insomnia rejects pure execution receipts and residual numbered prompt/phase/step progress; useful resulting state is accepted only after progress framing is removed | `insomnia::candidate_receipt_policy_tests::*` |
| Insomnia owner classification runs over fixed semantic groups, defaults conservatively to Project when absent, can assign only User/Project in the current contract, and cannot perturb candidate semantic identity | `insomnia::ownership_tests::*`, `insomnia::extraction_tests::two_pass_selector_and_wording_contracts_preserve_tuned_policy` |
| Routed Insomnia resolves and persists source-derived `source_time_ns`, publishes User Memories source-independently to the explicit PHY before committing the REL receipt, records them as owner-qualified `MemoryRef`s, and reuses a prewritten PHY Memory on retry through deterministic mutation identity | `insomnia::ownership_tests::routed_user_memory_uses_owner_qualified_receipt_and_no_rel_provenance`, `insomnia::ownership_tests::routed_retry_reuses_phy_memory_after_wording_drift` |
| Routed finite workers and the long-lived RuntimeHost vectorize User Memories in the attached PHY without creating Project REL Memories; RuntimeHost can enable/disable Insomnia, move one PHY between hosts without duplicating ownership, derive independent REL/PHY Dream backlogs after owner-local vector readiness, and expose owner-local Memory retrieval lanes | `insomnia::worker_vector_tests::routed_backlog_drain_vectorizes_user_memory_in_phylactery`, `runtime_host_tests::runtime_host_routes_user_memory_and_vectors_to_attached_phylactery`, `runtime_host_vector_tests::embedding_route_can_be_attached_after_memory_creation` |
| Provider HTTP 429 capacity/quota responses are typed as backpressure rather than ordinary inference failure: they never consume the normal finite attempt budget into Terminal, honor provider reset/retry hints with a conservative minimum cooldown, finite drains stop claiming new Episodes after the first backpressure wave, long-lived RuntimeHost workers share one provider-wide cooldown gate, and restart reuses the existing Failed/Processing → Pending recovery semantics | `insomnia::worker_backpressure_tests::finite_drain_pauses_on_backpressure_without_terminalizing_backlog`, `insomnia::worker_backpressure_tests::runtime_backpressure_ignores_normal_attempt_budget`, `runtime_host_backpressure_tests::runtime_host_gates_new_claims_during_provider_backpressure`, `insomnia::queue_recovery_tests::retry_delay_is_runtime_only_and_restart_requeues_immediately` |
| Reliquary reconciliation preserves external owner-qualified Memory refs in durable Insomnia completion receipts without attempting to absorb the referenced external owner | `cva_reconcile_grouped_tests::reconcile_replays_grouped_insomnia_memory_records` |
| Current Insomnia gold v3 contains exactly 40 unique source-anchored judgments (32 retain / 8 omit) with separate authority-source and grounding-source policy; four cases explicitly require grounding without assistant authority | `insomnia::gold_tests::insomnia_gold_set_is_well_formed_and_balanced` |
| Prepared corpus supports two independent simulated profiles/generations plus default hybrid retrieval | `examples/vector_generation_smoke.rs` |

## Future contracts

Before the shared live runtime ships, tests must prove that equivalent native and external-adapter interaction fixtures normalize to equivalent source semantics, that acknowledged source events survive restart under one explicit durability rule, and that transport metadata cannot become semantic authority.

Before CVA management/native UI ships, tests must prove that management mutations compose concrete owner APIs, preserve owner validation, and do not introduce a generic mutable semantic object layer.

Before concurrent writers are supported, tests must prove that unrelated sessions do not serialize on a semantic Archive head and that global/file-position reservation is the only required shared ordering boundary.

Before whole-CVA rollback ships, tests must define timeline selection across Archive, Memories, Graph, and vector domains without turning every write into a global state publication.

Before persistent checkpoints are added, larger-scale benchmarks must show that the remaining single-pass scan cost justifies the additional derived-state machinery.

## Notes

A tracked integer watermark is not by itself a historical materialization API; tests distinguish stored ordering metadata from features not yet exposed.
