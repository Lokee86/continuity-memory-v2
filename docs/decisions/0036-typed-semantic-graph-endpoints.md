# ADR 0036: Typed semantic Graph endpoints over Arcana

Parent index: [Architectural decisions](INDEX.md)

Amends [ADR 0024](0024-owner-local-dream-processing.md), [ADR 0033](0033-perception-entities-observations-and-ambiguity.md), and the Graph question retained in [Derived semantic nodes exploration](../derived-semantic-nodes-exploration.md).

## Status

Accepted — 2026-09-17. Typed node identity/catalogue foundation and durable Entity owner implemented; typed non-Memory relation persistence remains Milestone B work.

## Context

Reliquary's Graph is already an independent semantic owner backed by Arcana's repository-agnostic graph kernel. The implemented wrapper historically restricted every durable Graph endpoint to a same-owner `MemoryId` because Dream was the only semantic producer using it.

ADR 0033 adds two sibling first-class semantic objects:

```text
Memory | Entity | Observation
```

Entities and Observations are intended to function as real semantic nodes, not caches or Memory subtypes. Keeping separate hidden adjacency structures for Memory-to-Entity and support/derivation topology would duplicate the graph machinery that Arcana already supplies and would prevent one coherent semantic topology.

At the same time, node kinds do not share identical authority or lifecycle rules. Memory, Entity, and Observation records remain purpose-built semantic domains even when they share graph identity/topology machinery.

## Decision

Graph becomes the owner-local **semantic Graph substrate** for typed semantic-node topology.

A Graph node is addressed by a stable typed reference:

```text
SemanticNodeRef {
    kind = Memory | Entity | Observation
    id   = stable 32-byte owner-local semantic ID
}
```

The typed semantic identity maps to an internal dense `arcana::NodeId`. Arcana continues to own generic adjacency/topology/traversal mechanics only.

The semantic object payload remains owned by its purpose-built domain:

- Memory records remain owned by MemoryStore;
- Entity records are Perception-owned Entity state;
- Observation records are Perception-owned Observation state.

Graph does not become a generalized semantic object database.

## Semantic authority

Graph owns accepted relationship topology and relationship mutation history.

The producer that is allowed to publish a relation family remains explicit:

- **Dream** owns judgment/publication policy for Memory-to-Memory Dream relationship families.
- **Perception** owns judgment/publication policy for relation families involving Entity or Observation nodes.
- **User-authored** graph changes remain explicit user authority where supported.

Sharing Graph storage does not merge those semantic responsibilities.

## Owner boundary

The semantic Graph remains owner-local to one REL or PHY. A bare `SemanticNodeRef` is meaningful only inside that durable owner.

ADR 0034 cross-owner Relationships remain separate first-class containers using owner-qualified Entity references. This ADR does not create cross-owner Arcana edges or allow one owner's Graph to traverse another owner's private state.

## Communities

Dream/Leiden Communities remain a **Memory structural projection** unless a later measured design explicitly changes that contract.

Entity and Observation hubs must not automatically enter the Community projection merely because they are present in the broader semantic Graph. Community construction filters the authoritative Graph to the Memory relationship families it is designed to organize.

## Persistence compatibility

Existing Graph node mappings remain valid as implicit `SemanticNodeKind::Memory` records.

The typed node catalogue may use a new node-mapping record for non-Memory kinds while preserving legacy Memory node records. Existing Memory-to-Memory mutation/version records remain readable and retain their semantics.

Relation-record generalization is a separate implementation step and must preserve existing Dream Graph history.

## Consequences

- Arcana is reused rather than replaced.
- Memory, Entity, and Observation can share one topology/traversal substrate without sharing object lifecycle semantics.
- Entity associations do not require a second hidden adjacency database.
- Observation support/topology can later use the same graph substrate where its semantic contract is truly edge-shaped.
- Rich ADR 0034 Relationship containers remain distinct from ordinary Graph edges.
- Dream can later consume Entity IDs as a deterministic candidate-routing signal without owning Entity resolution.
- Existing Dream behavior remains valid as the Memory-only projection of the broader semantic Graph.

## Implementation sequence

1. Introduce `SemanticNodeKind` and `SemanticNodeRef`.
2. Generalize the Arcana dense-node catalogue from `MemoryId` to typed semantic-node identity.
3. Preserve legacy Memory node mapping compatibility.
4. Define the minimum durable Entity record and Entity owner.
5. Define and validate the first Memory-to-Entity relation family.
6. Generalize relation persistence/reconciliation to typed endpoints.
7. Wire calibrated Entity resolution into Entity creation/association.
8. Run the zero-Entity bootstrap experiment before adding unresolved lifecycle machinery.

## Verification

Implementation must protect at minimum:

- legacy Memory Graph reopen and traversal;
- distinct typed identity for identical raw IDs of different node kinds;
- stable typed-node to Arcana `NodeId` mapping;
- no cross-owner Graph traversal;
- existing Dream relation semantics unchanged;
- Memory-only Community projection unchanged until explicitly redesigned;
- no Entity/Observation payload authority moved into Graph; and
- no new unresolved retry/TTL policy implied by Graph generalization.
