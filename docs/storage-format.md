# Reliquary Storage Format
Parent index: [Documentation index](INDEX.md)
## Purpose
This document is the exact reference owner for persistent records currently implemented by Reliquary Memory v2.
## Overview
The shared container supports two typed semantic file kinds. A Reliquary `.rel` contains the full existing source/workspace owner composition: Archive source/history records, embedded and repository-backed file references, durable Project repository-revision correlations, durable interaction-stream checkpoints, turn-attached Echo execution evidence, mutable conversation-compaction state, Memories, Graph relationship state, clock-neutral Dream maintenance/pair-history records, derived Community snapshots and semantic-name records, Insomnia operational/completion records, vector backing/bindings, compatibility profiles, and vector generations. Most owners remain append-oriented; conversation compaction is an explicitly mutable variable-width owner with immediate free-space reclamation. A Phylactery `.phy` contains the narrower user-global owner set: Memories, Graph, clock-neutral Dream maintenance/pair-history records, derived Community snapshots and semantic-name records, Packed Vectors, Memory Vectors, Compatibility Profiles, and Ego Identity/Personality/Anchor/web-synthesis records. REL files may contain Ego Anchors and one cached owner-local web synthesis but reject PHY-only Identity/Personality records. Each top-level type opens the same physical stream but dispatches and validates only its permitted owners.

## Reliquary and Phylactery file identity — implemented

New Reliquary files use a 40-byte header carrying authoritative `file_kind = Reliquary`, a zero semantic-scope discriminator, and a 16-byte durable owner UUID. Current human-facing files use the generic `.rel` extension. Organizational labels such as Organization, Project, Program, or Subproject are append-only REL metadata and are not file identity.

The existing 16-byte `.cva` header and earlier/current-length typed REL headers remain readable as legacy data. Legacy typed discriminators are compatibility input only; opening them does not make the type behavioral. `migration::migrate_file` repacks an eligible legacy source into a separate current homogeneous REL while preserving or deliberately deriving stable semantic identities.

Phylactery `.phy` uses the same 40-byte typed header with authoritative `file_kind = Phylactery`, no Reliquary scope, and its own durable owner UUID. A `.phy` is not a legacy CVA and cannot be opened through the Reliquary/CVA lifecycle. Conversely, Phylactery rejects typed REL and legacy CVA files. See [ADR 0020](decisions/0020-reliquary-and-phylactery-file-kinds.md) and [ADR 0021](decisions/0021-typed-reliquary-scopes-and-connections.md).
## Exact contract
All integers and multi-byte scalar values are little-endian.
### Container header
| Offset | Size | Field | Value |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `0` | 8 | magic | `CVA\0\r\n\x1a\n` |
| `8` | 2 | major | `1` |
| `10` | 2 | minor | `0` |
| `12` | 4 | header length | `16` for legacy CVA; `24` for earlier typed files; `40` for current typed files |
| `16` | 1 | file kind | `1=Reliquary`; `2=Phylactery` |
| `17` | 1 | semantic scope discriminator | current Reliquary/Phylactery: `0`; legacy typed REL compatibility: `1=Organization`, `2=Project`, `3=Connection` |
| `18` | 6 | reserved | zero |
| `24` | 16 | durable owner UUID | UUID bytes; current typed files only |
Physical chunks follow:
```text
u64 payload_length
N bytes payload
```
`ChunkRef` stores the length-prefix offset and payload length.
### Global version ticket
Current ticket:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAVERS2"
u64       global version
i64       transaction_time_ns
```
Legacy ticket:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAVERS1"
u64       global version
```
Global versions begin at `1` and are semantically consecutive. Version order remains the canonical owner-local semantic mutation order. Current ordinary semantic publications persist one `CVAVERS2` ticket whose transaction timestamp records when the REL/PHY persistence layer allocated that version. `transaction_time_ns` is knowledge/system time only: it is distinct from source chronology (`source_time_ns`) and from world-valid time interpreted by Chronos.

Legacy `CVAVERS1` tickets remain readable but have no transaction timestamp; reopen does not invent one. Wall-clock historical-cut lookup therefore resolves only a contiguous global-version prefix whose included versions all have known timestamps no later than the requested cut. It does not skip an untimestamped version or a later-timestamped earlier version to reach a higher global version. This remains truthful when divergent reconciliation preserves branch transaction times that are not monotonic in the newly linearized version order. Current `CVAINSC5` completion transactions, and legacy `CVAINSC4` completions, are the atomic-range exception: they carry one explicit persistence-owned transaction timestamp for their contiguous embedded local REL Memory-version range, so those versions do not require standalone `CVAVERS2` chunks. Older `CVAINSC2`/`CVAINSC3` embedded ranges remain readable but untimestamped for transaction-time purposes. External owner-qualified Memory references and clock-neutral Memory routing metadata consume no REL global/Memory versions. Immutable backing objects do not independently consume versions.

### Durable owner identity

Current REL/PHY files store a 16-byte UUID directly in the container header. Current homogeneous RELs use canonical external owner ID `rel-<uuid>`; Phylactery uses `phy-<uuid>`. Legacy typed REL headers with an owner UUID retain their historical `proj-`, `org-`, or `con-` prefix so identity remains stable while those files are opened or reconciled. Owner identity consumes no semantic/global version ticket. Copies, moves, renames, reconciliation repacks, and format migration preserve or deliberately derive the UUID. Earlier 16-byte legacy CVA and 24-byte typed files have no header UUID and require explicit migration before owner-ID-based reconciliation.

Legacy `CVAWKFM1` / `CVAWKSP1` workspace-metadata chunks may remain physically present in old RELs, but current runtime semantics ignore them and do not write them.

### REL metadata

Current REL organizational/context metadata is append-only and latest-wins:

```text
8 bytes   "CVARELM1"
u8        type-label present: 0=false, 1=true
optional  string type label
u32       dependency count
repeated  string dependency REL owner ID
```

The type label is optional display/organization metadata only and must not select Reliquary behavior. Dependency IDs are sorted and unique and represent explicit directed context dependencies. Self-dependency is rejected by the REL owner; graph-cycle and mounted-closure validation belongs to the multi-REL host because one REL cannot inspect the complete graph by itself. REL metadata consumes no Archive, Memory, Graph, or Vector Generation version.

### Ego owner records

Ego persistence is owner-local, append-only, and clock-neutral with respect to the existing Container semantic global clock. Ego maintains its own contiguous `ego_version` beginning at `1`; each logical document/Anchor also has an optimistic local revision beginning at `1`. Missing Ego records mean empty Ego state.

PHY-only Identity records now support multiple stable Identity documents plus one active selection. New Identity revisions use:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAEIDN2"
u64       ego_version
16 bytes  Identity UUID
u64       identity revision
u8        deleted: 0=false, 1=true
u8        activate: 0=false, 1=true
string    UTF-8 Identity display name; empty only for tombstones
string    UTF-8 Identity text; empty only for tombstones
```
The first live Identity is created with `activate=1`; later Identity creation/update does not implicitly replace the active Identity. Deletion appends a tombstone. An active Identity cannot be deleted while another live Identity exists, so switching is explicit. Deleting the only Identity leaves the PHY with no active Identity.

Active Identity swaps are independent state transitions and do not revise either Identity document:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAEIDA1"
u64       ego_version
16 bytes  active Identity UUID
```
The target must identify a live Identity. Re-selecting the already-active Identity is an API no-op and writes no record.

Legacy single-Identity `CVAEIDN1` records remain readable. They are projected as one stable reserved Identity with display name `Default` and are active on reopen; new writes use `CVAEIDN2`/`CVAEIDA1`.

PHY-only Personality:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAEPER1"
u64       ego_version
u64       personality revision
u64       source_memory_version
string    UTF-8 Personality text
```
`source_memory_version` records the PHY Memory watermark from which the behavioral projection was synthesized. Personality is derived state in this contract; explicit user-authored conditioning belongs in Identity, Anchors, or the underlying communication memories. Reliquary open rejects either PHY-only record family.

PHY/REL Anchor:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAEANC1"
u64       ego_version
16 bytes  Anchor UUID
u64       Anchor revision
u8        deleted: 0=false, 1=true
u8        priority: 1=High, 2=Normal, 3=Low
string    UTF-8 Anchor text; empty only for tombstones
```
Live Anchor text is limited to 2,500 Unicode scalar-value characters. Updates append a new revision. Deletion appends a tombstone and preserves history.

PHY/REL cached Memory-Web synthesis:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAESYN1"
u64       ego_version
u64       synthesis revision
u64       source_memory_version
string    UTF-8 synthesis text
```
The source Memory version is a deterministic stale-input watermark; it may trail the owner's current `memory_version` but may not exceed it. Direct writes and reopen validation reject impossible future source cuts. The record does not itself run synthesis or claim Memory/Dream authority. Identity, Personality, and synthesis storage impose no policy-level text cap beyond the underlying length-prefixed record representation; context-budget bounds belong to later Ego synthesis/assembly policy. Ego records consume no `CVAVERS1`, Archive version, Memory version, Graph version, or Vector Generation version.

### Interaction-stream checkpoints

Interaction-stream checkpoint:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAISTR1"
string    message ID
string    session/conversation ID
u8        parent present: 0=false, 1=true
optional  string parent message ID
u8        role: 0=User, 1=Agent
i64       timestamp_ns
u8        status: 0=Streaming, 1=Interrupted
string    cumulative UTF-8 content
```

Strings in this record use `u32 byte_length + UTF-8 bytes`. Interaction-stream records are append-only checkpoint revisions keyed by message ID; reopening keeps the latest valid revision for each message. Metadata is immutable across revisions and content must be append-only. `Interrupted` is terminal within one physical history.

These records are durable transcript state, not Archive semantic records. They consume no `CVAVERS1`, Archive version, Memory version, or Vector Generation version. A live runtime may expose the latest `Streaming` checkpoint as streaming only while the matching in-memory message is still active; after restart that same on-disk record is interpreted as interrupted. If the same message ID later exists as a completed Archive node, transcript resolution suppresses the checkpoint copy and uses the completed Archive turn.

Divergent Reliquary reconciliation retains and merges interaction-stream records independently of Archive semantic history. Compatible prefix histories keep the longest visible content and retain `Interrupted` if either side recorded interruption; non-prefix text or immutable-metadata divergence is rejected rather than silently discarding user-visible output.

### Echo sidecar records

Echo is durable turn-attached execution evidence stored inside REL files but outside the Archive/Memory semantic search populations. The initial record is append-only and keyed by `(conversation_id, message_id, sequence)`:

```text
8 bytes   "CVAECHO1"
string    conversation ID
string    message/turn ID
u64       sequence
i64       timestamp_ns
u8        model round present
optional  u32 model round
u8        event kind
optional  string correlation ID
optional  string name
string    content
```

Event kinds are `ReasoningSummary`, `Commentary`, `ReasoningTrace`, `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, `ActivityStarted`, `ActivityCompleted`, and `ActivityFailed`. Records use typed binary fields and length-prefixed UTF-8 strings; they do not embed a JSON envelope. Sequence is authoritative for execution order. Identical replay is idempotent; conflicting events at the same turn sequence fail closed.

Echo consumes no global, Archive, Memory, Graph, or Vector Generation version. Existing current REL files require no physical rewrite: absence of `CVAECHO1` means the Echo store is empty, and new records may be appended normally. Explicit legacy REL migration republishes Echo records into the new REL, and divergent REL reconciliation preserves Echo from both copies. Provider continuation state is not Echo semantic evidence and is not represented by this record family.

### Project repository correlation records

Repository-associated RELs may persist an append-only correlation between one REL semantic cut and one exact project-repository revision. These records are repository-neutral and are not project-file history themselves.

Current record:

```text
8 bytes   "PRJCOR02"
u64       correlation sequence
u64       REL global version cut
u64       REL Archive version cut
u64       REL Memory version cut
u8        repository kind: 1=Lore, 2=Git
u8        repository management: 1=WarlockManaged, 2=External
string    durable repository ID
string    repository-relative selected project path
string    opaque repository revision/commit reference
```

Legacy `PRJCOR01` omits the repository-management byte. Reopen assigns the compatibility default: Lore = `WarlockManaged`, Git = `External`.

Correlation sequence begins at `1` and is contiguous. Repository kind and durable repository ID must remain stable across one REL's correlation history; the selected project path and management policy may change within that repository. Project paths are normalized repository-relative paths using `/`; `.` represents repository root. Absolute paths, backslashes, empty path components, and `.`/`..` components are rejected.

A correlation write is idempotent only when the latest record already has the same REL cut, repository revision, and management policy. Correlation records consume no REL global, Archive, Memory, Graph, or Vector Generation version. Their `RelSemanticCut` is a cross-history observation, not another semantic mutation clock.

Strict-copy/extension reconciliation preserves correlation history verbatim. A true divergent semantic repack allocates new REL clocks, so branch-local cuts cannot be reused. Reconciliation instead requires the `(ProjectRevisionRef, ProjectRepositoryManagement)` histories to be prefix-compatible and, when the merge changes canonical state, emits one fresh correlation at the final merged REL cut using the latest compatible project revision. Divergent repository histories fail closed.

### Project-backed file bindings

Project-backed transcript/provenance attachments may reference exact historical repository files without copying their payload bytes into REL content storage. The durable binding is:

```text
8 bytes   "PRJFILE1"
32 bytes  FileId
u8        repository kind: 1=Lore, 2=Git
u8        content-hash present: 0=false, 1=true
optional  32-byte SHA-256 content hash
string    durable repository ID
string    repository-relative selected project path
string    opaque repository revision/commit reference
string    repository-relative file path
```

A `FileId` may have at most one Project-file binding. Replaying the identical binding is idempotent; a different binding for the same `FileId` is rejected. Repository ID and revision must be non-empty. Project and file paths are normalized repository-relative `/` paths; the file path must remain inside the selected project subtree unless the subtree is repository root (`.`).

`PRJFILE1` is clock-neutral repository-reference metadata. The associated Archive attachment manifest remains the transcript/provenance-visible file identity, while project-file bytes are resolved from the recorded repository revision and verified against the stored content hash when present. REL deliberately stores no duplicate `CVACONT1` payload for a repository-backed file.

### Conversation compaction store

Conversation compaction is durable derived conversation state stored only in REL files. Records are keyed by conversation plus branch checkpoint (`through_message_id`) and carry a generation plus UTF-8 summary. The store uses variable-width physical chunks rather than append-only semantic publication. Replacement writes the new live record and syncs it before reclaiming the superseded allocation. Reclaimed chunks are marked free, reused before file growth, split when oversized, coalesced when adjacent, and physically truncated when a coalesced free extent reaches end-of-file.

Free extents and obsolete/superseded allocations are allocator state, not durable semantic history. Reopen recovers incomplete supersession and completes reclamation. Sibling-branch live checkpoints may coexist. Compaction records consume no `CVAVERS1`, Archive version, Memory version, or Vector Generation version and are excluded from semantic ancestry comparison. Explicit legacy REL migration republishes only live compaction records; free/reclaimed physical extents are not copied.

### Archive records
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAAFMT2"
u32       schema = 1
```
Content:
```text
8 bytes   "CVACONT1"
32 bytes  ContentId = SHA-256(content)
u32       byte length
N bytes   arbitrary content bytes
```
Node:
```text
8 bytes   "CVANODE2"
i64       timestamp_ns
32 bytes  ContentId
string    node ID
string    conversation ID
string    parent node ID; empty = none
string    role
string    principal_id; empty = none
```
Legacy `CVANODE1` omits `principal_id` and reopens with no principal; Reliquary never invents one during decode or reconciliation.
Branch/session head:
```text
8 bytes   "CVABRCH1"
u8        canonical
string    branch ID
string    conversation ID
string    leaf node ID
```
Current branch enumeration is reconstructed from the latest visible revision for each `(conversation ID, branch ID)` pair; it adds no persistent record type.
Conversation metadata:
```text
8 bytes   "CVACONV1"
string    conversation ID
string    title; empty = none
```
Conversation metadata is conversation-owned Archive semantic state, independent of branch topology. Records are append-only revisions keyed by conversation ID; reopening keeps the latest version, and identical metadata publication is idempotent.
Fragment:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAFRAG1"
32 bytes  FragmentId
string    conversation ID
string    start node ID
string    end node ID
```
The same deterministic window calculation may also be used transiently for read-only live-branch search. Those transient windows are ordinary in-memory `Fragment` values only: search does not write `CVAFRAG1` or `CVAAREC1`, advance Archive/global clocks, or alter the persisted Fragment population.
Episode:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAEPIS1"
32 bytes  EpisodeId
u8        origin: 1=Live, 2=Import
u8        boundary: 1=Size, 2=Inactivity, 3=CreateMemory, 4=ImportEnd
i64       source_through_ns
i64       finalized_at_ns
string    conversation ID
string    start node ID
string    end node ID
```
`EpisodeId` is SHA-256 over the conversation ID, start node ID, and end node ID in order, with each value encoded as `u64 byte_length + UTF-8 bytes`. Episodes are Archive semantic records and are published through ordinary `CVAAREC1` metadata.

File manifest:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAFILE1"
32 bytes  FileId
32 bytes  ContentId
u64       original byte length
string    filename
string    MIME type; empty = none
```
File bytes reuse the content-addressed `CVACONT1` store. `FileId` is SHA-256 over the `CVAFILE1-ID\0` domain separator, `ContentId`, byte length, length-prefixed filename, and length-prefixed MIME type. Identical bytes therefore share one content object while distinct filenames or MIME metadata remain distinct file manifests. `CVAFILE1` remains the standalone semantic representation for files introduced outside a source turn.

Native source turn with attachments:
```text
8 bytes   "CVATURN2"
i64       timestamp_ns
32 bytes  node ContentId
string    node ID
string    conversation ID
string    parent node ID; empty = none
string    role
string    principal_id; empty = none
u32       attachment count
repeated attachments:
    32 bytes  FileId
    32 bytes  ContentId
    u64       original byte length
    string    filename
    string    MIME type; empty = none
```
The turn body and attachment bytes are stored first as content-addressed `CVACONT1` backing objects. One versioned `CVATURN2` then publishes the source node, its optional principal identity, attachment file manifests, and the source-to-file relationship together. Legacy `CVATURN1` omits `principal_id` and decodes it as absent. An unversioned native-turn record is inert. Attached files therefore require no later source-association record or importer-side repair step.

File-to-Memory link:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAFMEM1"
32 bytes  FileId
32 bytes  MemoryId
```
The `(FileId, MemoryId)` pair is the link identity. The file must exist in Archive when the link is written; `Cva` validates the Memory target after both Archive and Memories have rebuilt. This record represents a later semantic relationship and is intentionally separate from native source attachment provenance.

Archive semantic metadata:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAAREC1"
u64       global version
u64       Archive version
u64       record chunk offset
u64       record payload length
```
Archive versions begin at `1` and are contiguous. A semantic Archive payload without valid metadata is inert. Nodes, native source turns, branches, fragments, episodes, standalone file manifests, and file-to-Memory links are semantic Archive payloads. One `CVATURN1` consumes one Archive/global version regardless of its attachment count. Fragment creation Archive versions are retained in the derived fragment index so later generation coverage can be validated.

### Phylactery owner composition

A current `.phy` initializes and requires the persistent formats for Memories, Graph, Packed Vectors, Memory Vectors, and Compatibility Profiles, and accepts optional Ego Identity/Personality/Anchor/web-synthesis records. Community snapshots and Community-name records are optional clock-neutral chunks and appear only after their explicit maintenance/edit operations. It does not initialize or accept Archive/Episode semantics, Files/attachments, Insomnia operational/completion state, Archive Vectors, Vector Generations, or interaction-stream checkpoints as Phylactery owners.

The same Memory record codec is reused, but current Phylactery validity is stricter about ownership: `source_episode_id`, `source_node_id`, `content_source_conversation_id`, `content_source_node_id`, `grounding_source_conversation_id`, and `grounding_source_node_id` must all be absent because those are same-owner REL provenance fields. A PHY Memory may instead carry optional `MemorySourceRef`, an identifier-only cross-owner provenance field containing the originating REL owner ID, optional source-turn PHY `principal_id`, Episode ID, primary source node ID, and optional authority/grounding conversation-node identities. No source body is copied into PHY, and an unavailable referenced REL does not invalidate the PHY. `source_time_ns` remains separate semantic chronology.

The existing disposable lexical index indexes REL Archive Fragments and filenames, so it is not part of `.phy`. A user-Memory lexical index, if required, is a separate future derived owner/design.

### Memories
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAMEMF2"
```
Standalone content-addressed Memory body:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAMBDY1"
32 bytes  MemoryBodyId = SHA-256(exact body bytes)
u32       body byte length
N bytes   body bytes
```
The exact body bytes are:
```text
u64       title UTF-8 byte length
N bytes   title UTF-8
u64       content UTF-8 byte length
N bytes   content UTF-8
```
Memory record:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAMEMR8"
32 bytes  MemoryId
u64       revision
32 bytes  MemoryBodyId
u8        archived: 0=false, 1=true
optional  MemoryId superseded_by
optional  MemoryId parent_id
optional  EpisodeId source_episode_id
optional  i64 source_time_ns
optional  MemorySourceRef source_ref
          string owner_id
          optional string principal_id
          32 bytes EpisodeId source_episode_id
          string source_node_id
          optional string content_source_conversation_id
          optional string content_source_node_id
          optional string grounding_source_conversation_id
          optional string grounding_source_node_id
i64       created_at_ns
i64       updated_at_ns
string    category
string    memory_type
string    authority_kind
string    scope
string    lifecycle_state
string    temporal_status
optional  string source_node_id
optional  string content_source_conversation_id
optional  string content_source_node_id
optional  string grounding_source_conversation_id
optional  string grounding_source_node_id
string    mutation_id
optional  verified temporal inference
          32 bytes MemoryBodyId binding
          optional i64 source_time_ns binding
          string model
          string contract_version
          u8 resolution count (1..=32)
          repeated resolutions:
              u32 start_byte
              u32 end_byte
              u8 indication kind: 1=Explicit, 2=Calendar, 3=Relative, 4=Boundary, 5=Recurrence, 6=Duration
              string original evidence
              string canonical_expression
```
Optional fixed IDs, optional `source_time_ns`, optional `source_ref`, and optional strings use a one-byte `0`/`1` presence flag followed by the encoded value when present. `source_ref` stores identifiers only; it does not embed source content. `source_time_ns` records source-derived semantic chronology independently of the reference and is distinct from Memory creation/update bookkeeping. `authority_kind` is one of `direct`, `correction`, `adoption`, `retention`, or `unknown`; current Insomnia writes the first four, while legacy/manual records may use `unknown`. `temporal_status` is the Insomnia proposition-time classification `current`, `future`, or `historical`; `unknown` is accepted only as the compatibility value for legacy/manual Memories whose original classification was not persisted. This field is independent of Dream-owned `lifecycle_state`: temporal status describes how the proposition was framed when extracted, while Dream lifecycle describes the Memory's current owner-local semantic state. `MemoryId` for an automatically assigned new Memory is SHA-256 over `"continuity-memory-id\0"`, the mutation-ID byte length as `u64`, and the mutation-ID UTF-8 bytes. A Memory's `MemoryBodyId` cannot change across revisions. A current R7 record may additionally carry verified nondeterministic Chronos inference. The inference is valid only when its embedded `MemoryBodyId` and `source_time_ns` exactly match the enclosing record. It stores the producing model/contract plus each original unresolved source span/kind/evidence and a non-empty canonical expression that passed deterministic same-kind Chronos verification. Lifecycle/metadata revisions may carry it forward only while that binding remains exact; a changed body/reference binding drops the prior inference as stale. Deterministic Chronos products are never stored in this field.

Legacy `CVAMEMR6`, `CVAMEMR5`, `CVAMEMR4`, `CVAMEMR3`, and `CVAMEMR2` records remain decodable. R6 has durable `temporal_status` but predates verified temporal inference and therefore reopens with `temporal_inference = None`. R5 retains `source_time_ns` and `source_ref` but predates durable `temporal_status`; reopen assigns `temporal_status = "unknown"` rather than guessing a lost classifier result. R4 additionally predates the external source reference and reopens with `source_ref = None`. R3 lacks both `source_time_ns` and `source_ref`. R2 additionally lacks `authority_kind`; reopen assigns `authority_kind = "unknown"` rather than inferring provenance that was never persisted. An explicit metadata-only Memory revision may backfill `unknown` temporal status without changing the immutable Memory body, source chronology, provenance, or Dream lifecycle.

Standalone Memory publication metadata:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAMEMV1"
u64       global version
u64       Memory version
u64       record chunk offset
u64       record payload length
```
Memory versions begin at `1` and are dense. Normal direct Memory publication may store/deduplicate a standalone body, append `CVAMEMR8`, allocate one global version, and append `CVAMEMV1`; a standalone Memory record without valid version metadata is inert. `CVAMEMR7` remains readable and its `MemorySourceRef` decodes with no `principal_id`. Successful current Insomnia processing uses the `CVAINSC5` transaction described below instead: newly required local REL Memory bodies, `CVAMEMR8` records, their body-bound routing metadata, and their contiguous global-version range become visible through the one outer completion chunk and do not emit separate body/record/version/global-ticket chunks before it. User-owned PHY Memories are separate owner publications and are referenced from the REL completion by owner-qualified `MemoryRef`, not embedded as REL Memory records.

Clock-neutral Memory Entity-routing metadata may also be stored as a standalone attachment (used by PHY publication, migration, and semantic reconciliation). New writes use:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAMRTE2"
32 bytes  MemoryId
32 bytes  MemoryBodyId
u32       Entity-mention count (0..=64)
repeated Entity mentions:
    u8    text field: 1=title, 2=content
    u32   start UTF-8 byte offset
    u32   end UTF-8 byte offset
    string exact mention text
```
Every mention string is limited to 512 UTF-8 bytes. `MemoryId + MemoryBodyId` must identify the current immutable Memory body, and mention offsets must be valid character boundaries that slice to the stored text exactly. One Memory may have at most one routing attachment: identical replay is idempotent and a different attachment for the same Memory conflicts. `CVAMRTE2` consumes no global or Memory version and carries no Entity ID/type/identity decision.

Legacy `CVAMRTE1` remains readable. It has the same Entity-mention prefix followed by `u32 lexical-term count` and repeated exact lexical strings. Those former model-generated lexical terms are consumed only for compatibility validation while decoding and are discarded; they are not republished into current routing metadata. Lexical Memory search is now fully derived from complete current Memory title/content through the disposable owner-local Memory lexical index, so no lexical strings are persisted in new routing attachments.

### Entities

Entity owner format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAENTF1"
```

Entity revision payload:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAENTR1"
32 bytes  EntityId
u64       Entity revision
i64       created_at_ns
i64       updated_at_ns
string    canonical_name
u16       alias count
repeated:
    string alias
string    kind
string    semantic summary
string    mutation_id
```

Entity publication metadata:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAENTV1"
u64       global version
u64       Entity version
u64       record chunk offset
u64       record payload length
```

Entity versions begin at `1` and are dense. One Entity revision consumes one owner-global semantic version and one Entity-local version. A record without matching version metadata is inert. Automatically assigned `EntityId` is SHA-256 over the domain separator `"reliquary-entity-id\0"` plus mutation-ID length and bytes. Canonical name, aliases, kind, and summary may change across revisions without changing Entity identity; `created_at_ns` is invariant for an existing Entity. Aliases are normalized, sorted, unique, and bounded. Entity records intentionally contain no supporting Memory IDs or graph adjacency; Memory↔Entity association belongs to Graph. Legacy REL/PHY files without this owner reopen with an empty EntityStore.

### Graph
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAGFMT1"
u32       schema = 1
```

Legacy Memory node mapping remains readable:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAGNODE"
32 bytes  MemoryId
u32       dense NodeId
```

Typed non-Memory node mapping:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAGNOD2"
u8        SemanticNodeKind: 1=Memory, 2=Entity, 3=Observation
32 bytes  owner-local semantic node ID
u32       dense NodeId
```

Memory nodes continue to use `CVAGNODE` for byte-level compatibility and decode as `SemanticNodeRef::Memory`. Dense Arcana IDs are internal topology indexes; stable semantic identity remains the typed owner-local reference.

Legacy Memory-only relationship mutation remains readable and is still emitted for Memory-only transactions:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAGMUT1"
32 bytes  source MemoryId
32 bytes  target MemoryId
u16       Memory relationship kind
u8        active: 0=retracted, 1=active
u8        origin: 1=Dream, 2=User
```

Typed semantic relationship mutation:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAGMUT2"
u8+32     source SemanticNodeRef
u8+32     target SemanticNodeRef
u16       semantic relationship kind
u8        active: 0=retracted, 1=active
u8        origin: 1=Dream, 2=User, 3=Perception
```

Legacy Memory-only atomic batches use `CVAGBAT1`; typed/mixed atomic batches use `CVAGBAT2` and repeat the corresponding typed endpoint/kind/active/origin fields. Memory relationship kind codes remain `1=topical`, `2=factual`, `3=causal`, `4=recurrent`, `5=references`, `6=duplicate-of`, `7=supersedes`, and `8=structural-parent`. Semantic kind `100=entity-association` is the ordinary directional `Memory -> Entity` Perception relation. Semantic kind `101=principal-association` is the reserved directional `Memory -> principal Entity` relation used for PHY-backed user identity; it is durable but omitted from ordinary semantic traversal/projection and exposed only through explicit principal lookup. Observation relation families are not yet accepted because no durable Observation owner exists.

One batch cannot contain the same oriented `(source, target, kind)` identity more than once. Already-visible no-op states are removed before publication. Endpoint validation is relation-specific: Memory relation families require two same-owner Memories; `entity-association` requires an existing same-owner Memory source and non-principal Entity target; `principal-association` requires an existing same-owner Memory source and an Entity whose reserved kind is `principal`.

Relationship version metadata is unchanged:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAGVER1"
u64       global version
u64       graph version
u64       mutation payload chunk offset
u64       mutation payload length
```

`graph_version` begins at `1`, is dense across **all** semantic Graph transactions, and is the optimistic concurrency clock for Graph publication. One non-empty transaction consumes one file-global semantic version plus one Graph-local version regardless of change count. A mutation payload without matching version metadata is inert. Retraction appends `active=0` rather than deleting history.

Graph also derives a non-persisted `memory_graph_version`: the latest full `graph_version` containing a Memory-to-Memory relation mutation, or `0` when no Memory relation has ever been published. Dream/Leiden/Memory-retrieval derived state keys to this Memory projection watermark, while Graph writes continue to compare against the full `graph_version`. Entity-only mutations therefore remain visible in the semantic Graph without invalidating unchanged Memory-only topology.

The Arcana kernel materializes two derived in-memory views from the same accepted relation authority: the full typed semantic topology and a Memory-only topology used by existing Dream traversal and Communities. Pre-Graph CVAs with no Graph records reopen at version `0`.

### Dream maintenance records

Dream maintenance metadata is owner-local, append-only, and clock-neutral. It is stored in both REL and PHY containers but is not a Memory revision, Graph relationship, Archive mutation, or semantic global-version claimant.

Current cooldown record:

```text
8 bytes   "CVADREM2"
32 bytes  MemoryId
u64       last satisfied provenance-relative Dream epoch
i64       last successful Dream processing timestamp_ns
```

The timestamp is runtime scheduling metadata. It may anchor maintenance eligibility when semantic source chronology cannot be recovered, but it never substitutes for source chronology in Dream temporal analysis, duplicate ordering, causality, supersession, or other semantic reasoning.

Legacy cooldown record:

```text
8 bytes   "CVADREM1"
32 bytes  MemoryId
u64       last satisfied provenance-relative Dream epoch
```

`CVADREM1` remains readable. It has no successful-processing timestamp; legacy state may use existing Memory update bookkeeping only as a one-time non-flooding maintenance bootstrap until a successful Dream pass writes `CVADREM2`.

Completed unordered Dream-pair evaluation:

```text
8 bytes   "CVADRP01"
32 bytes  lower canonical MemoryId
32 bytes  upper canonical MemoryId
```

The two IDs are stored in canonical byte order, so evaluating the pair from either source direction has one identity. Self-pairs are invalid. A record means Dream successfully completed evaluation/publication for that immutable Memory pair, including a `none` classification or withheld relation that produced no Graph edge. Candidate discovery excludes these pairs, as well as pairs already connected by an active Graph edge, before bounded candidate ranking.

Cooldown records reconstruct the maximum satisfied epoch and latest available successful-processing timestamp per Memory. Pair records reconstruct a set union. Divergent REL reconciliation applies those same monotonic merge rules. Explicit legacy REL/PHY migration copies both record families after their Memory endpoints have been republished. These records consume no `CVAVERS1`, Archive version, Memory version, Graph version, or Vector Generation version.

### Community snapshots

Community snapshots are optional derived records. There is no required Community format marker; absence means that no partition has been materialized for the current file history.

```text
8 bytes   "CVACOMM1"
u32       schema = 1
u64       generation
u64       derived Graph version
u32       community algorithm version
u64       Leiden seed
f64       Leiden resolution
f64       partition quality
u32       community count
repeated communities:
    32 bytes  CommunityId
    u32       member count
    N×32      ordered MemoryIds
```

Community generations begin at `1` and are contiguous across Community snapshot chunks, but this generation is derived-state bookkeeping only: it consumes no `CVAVERS1` ticket and is not a semantic timeline. The latest snapshot is current only when its derived Graph version equals current `memory_graph_version`.

A current snapshot partitions every current Memory-projection node exactly once; Entity and Observation nodes are excluded from the Dream/Leiden projection unless a later decision explicitly changes that contract. Communities are stored in ascending `CommunityId` order and members in ascending `MemoryId` byte order. `CommunityId` is SHA-256 over `"reliquary-community-v1\0"`, the 16-byte durable owner UUID, member count as little-endian `u64`, and ordered member IDs. This v1 identity is exact-membership identity and does not imply continuity after membership changes.

Algorithm version `1` is the legacy monolithic Leiden baseline. It projects active oriented Graph relationships onto unordered structural pairs, collapses multiple relationship identities between the same unordered Memory pair to one edge with weight `1.0`, and clusters the complete owner projection with Leiden modularity at resolution `1.0` and seed `0x4c454944454e0001`. Version `1` snapshots remain readable derived state.

Algorithm version `2` keeps the same structural projection, modularity resolution, and seed but computes the complete partition through deterministic scan-and-merge. A graph-local BFS order is divided into fixed 2,048-node leaf shards. Shard-local Leiden runs may execute concurrently; their results are reduced through a binary merge tree. Every original structural edge participates exactly once: same-shard edges enter the leaf run, while a cross-shard edge enters the lowest merge level containing both endpoints. Parent runs use weighted coarse edges/self-loops representing the complete child subgraphs. Worker count is deliberately not persisted because it changes scheduling only; the persisted partition must be worker-count invariant. The projection and all reduction summaries are derived computation only and do not change persisted Graph orientation or vocabulary.

A stale or older-algorithm snapshot may remain physically present. Explicit refresh appends a new complete snapshot using the current algorithm version. `CommunityStats.current` requires both current `graph_version` and current community algorithm version. Semantic repacks may omit Community snapshots and rebuild them later from Graph authority.

Community semantic names are separate optional clock-neutral records:

```text
8 bytes   "CVACNAM1"
u32       schema = 3
u32       Dream naming contract version; `0` for user-authored names
u8        source: 1=Dream, 2=User
32 bytes  exact-membership CommunityId
32 bytes  baseline CommunityId
u32       representative Memory count
repeated  32-byte MemoryId
u32       UTF-8 name byte length
N bytes   semantic name
```

The current Dream naming contract version is `2`. Dream records carry contract versions `1..=2` and 1–8 sorted unique representative Memory IDs from the named Community. Version `2` uses the four existing Community sub-centroids and targets two representative Memories per sub-centroid. User-authored records carry contract version `0`, source `User`, and zero representative Memory IDs. Directly persisted schema-3 records require `baseline CommunityId == CommunityId`; the baseline marks the exact membership against which the name was authored/generated. Current-name resolution may project that record through deterministic Community lineage without appending another name record. User names follow clear continuation lineage without a material-change cutoff. Dream names follow clear lineage only while the current Community remains at least 0.750 Jaccard-similar to the stored baseline. All records store a trimmed non-empty UTF-8 name no longer than 96 bytes. Latest direct record for one `CommunityId` wins. Historical schema-1 and schema-2 `CVACNAM1` records remain readable and infer their stored Community ID as the baseline. Naming records consume no `CVAVERS1`, Graph version, Community generation, Memory version, or Vector Generation version. Representative IDs record which Memory texts informed Dream; vectors themselves are never persisted in this record or sent as naming evidence.

### Packed vectors
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAPVFM1"
u32       schema = 1
```
Matrix object:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAPVEC1"
32 bytes  PackedVectorId
u32       dimensions
u8        scalar tag
3 bytes   reserved = 0
u64       row count
u64       matrix byte length
N bytes   contiguous rows
```
`row_bytes = dimensions * scalar_width`; matrix length must equal `row_count * row_bytes`. Scalar tags: `1=i8`, `2=u8`, `3=i16`, `4=u16`, `5=i32`, `6=u32`, `7=i64`, `8=u64`, `9=f16`, `10=bf16`, `11=f32`, `12=f64`.
Packed-vector ID is SHA-256 over `"CVA-PACKED-VECTOR-V1\0"`, dimensions, scalar tag, and exact matrix bytes.
### Memory Vectors
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAMVFM1"
u32       schema = 1
```
Row-binding object:
```text
8 bytes        "CVAMVEC1"
32 bytes       MemoryVectorId
32 bytes       CompatibilityProfileId
32 bytes       PackedVectorId
u64            row count
row_count × 32 ordered MemoryBodyIds
```
Row `N` maps to `memory_body_ids[N]`. Matrix row count must match exactly, the matrix must be `f32` with dimensions equal to the compatibility profile, and every `MemoryBodyId` must exist and be unique within the set. Across all Memory-Vector objects, a `(CompatibilityProfileId, MemoryBodyId)` pair may appear only once. `MemoryVectorId` is SHA-256 over `"CVA-MEMORY-VECTORS-V1\0"`, the profile ID, `PackedVectorId`, and ordered `MemoryBodyId`s.

Memory Vectors are immutable derived bindings and consume no semantic version ticket. Memory revisions may change metadata but cannot change their semantic `MemoryBodyId`; therefore no Memory-vector regeneration/update record exists. A new compatibility profile may bind the same Memory body to another immutable vector.
### Archive Vectors
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAAVFM1"
u32       schema = 1
```
Row-binding object:
```text
8 bytes        "CVAAVEC1"
32 bytes       ArchiveVectorId
32 bytes       PackedVectorId
u64            row count
row_count × 32 ordered FragmentIds
```
Row `N` maps to `fragment_ids[N]`. Matrix row count must match exactly; every fragment must exist and be unique within the set. `ArchiveVectorId` is SHA-256 over `"CVA-ARCHIVE-VECTORS-V1\0"`, `PackedVectorId`, and ordered `FragmentId`s. Compatibility and source-Archive metadata are excluded.
### Compatibility profiles
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVACPFM1"
u32       schema = 1
```
Profile object:
```text
8 bytes   "CVACPRO1"
32 bytes  CompatibilityProfileId
u32       dimensions
u8        normalization: 0=None, 1=L2
3 bytes   reserved = 0
u32       probe-suite version
u32       compatibility-policy version
u32       reference count
repeated references:
    u8    mode: 1=Query, 2=Document
    3     reserved = 0
    u32   vector length
    N×f32 reference values
```
Current probe suite v1 stores two Query and two Document references. Compatibility policy v2 requires corresponding probe vectors from an endpoint to have cosine similarity `>= 0.9998`, with dimensions, normalization, suite version, and policy version equal.
`CompatibilityProfileId` content-addresses the exact stored contract using `"CVA-COMPATIBILITY-PROFILE-V1\0"`, dimensions, normalization, suite/policy versions, and ordered mode+`f32` reference values. Exact ID equality is not the compatibility test; tolerant probe comparison is.
Provider, model, route, and revision metadata are not stored in compatibility profiles. Profiles are immutable and consume no semantic version.
### Vector generations
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAVGFM2"
u32       schema = 1
```
Generation payload:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAVGEN2"
32 bytes  VectorGenerationId
32 bytes  CompatibilityProfileId
32 bytes  ArchiveVectorId
u64       source Archive version
```
Generation version metadata:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAVGRC2"
u64       global version
u64       vector version
u64       generation payload chunk offset
u64       generation payload length
```
`VectorGenerationId` is SHA-256 over `"CVA-VECTOR-GENERATION-V2\0"`, compatibility-profile ID, Archive-Vector ID, and source Archive version. Vector versions begin at `1` and are contiguous inside `VectorGenerationStore`. An unversioned generation payload is inert.
The latest published generation for each compatibility profile is current. Source Archive version may not regress for that profile, exceed current Archive state, or predate any fragment in the referenced Archive-Vector set. Current generation publication requires the referenced packed matrix to use `f32`; packed storage remains generic, but alternate searchable scalar representations are not semantic generation formats until their interpretation is defined.
### Insomnia operational records
Format marker:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAINSF1"
```
Legacy/final work-state record:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAINSW1"
32 bytes  EpisodeId
u8        priority
u8        work state
u32       attempt count
i64       updated_at_ns
optional string lease owner
optional 32-byte lease token
optional i64 lease expiry
optional i64 retry-after
optional string last error
```
`CVAINSW1` remains decodable for existing development files and is still used for one final Terminal outcome during the current compatibility slice. New Pending, Processing, renewal, Failed/retry, and lease-expiry transitions are runtime-only and do not emit records. On reopen, persisted transient Work states are ignored; every Episode without a final success/terminal outcome is re-derived as Pending from Archive Episode metadata. Old Complete/Terminal records remain compatible final state.

Current successful Episode completion:
```text
8 bytes   "CVAINSC5"
32 bytes  EpisodeId
u32       attempt number
i64       started_at_ns
i64       completed_at_ns
u32       rejected candidate count
u64       first embedded global version
u32       embedded global-version count
i64       transaction_time_ns
string    extractor model
string    extractor contract/version
u32       local Project MemoryId count
N×32      local resulting MemoryIds
u32       external MemoryRef count
repeated external Memory refs:
    string owner_id
    32     MemoryId
u32       embedded local Memory-body count
repeated embedded Memory bodies:
    32    MemoryBodyId
    u32   Memory-body byte length
    N     exact Memory body bytes: u64 title byte length + UTF-8 title + u64 content byte length + UTF-8 content
u32       newly published local Memory-record count
repeated newly published records:
    u64   global version
    u64   memory version
    u32   encoded Memory-record length
    N     complete "CVAMEMR8" record payload
u32       embedded routing-metadata count
repeated embedded routing metadata:
    u32   encoded routing-metadata length
    N     complete "CVAMRTE1" payload
```
The embedded global-version count must equal the newly published local Memory-record count. For a non-empty local publication, record global versions are contiguous beginning at the stored first version. A completion with no new local REL Memories consumes no REL global versions even when it records external Memory references.

`CVAINSC5` is the physical and logical visibility boundary for the REL side of an Insomnia success. Its `transaction_time_ns` is sampled by the Container immediately before publication and applies to every embedded global version in that atomic completion. New local content-addressed Memory bodies, their Memory records, their body-bound routing metadata, their global-version allocation, owner-qualified external Memory references, and the compact successful Episode receipt all live inside this one outer REL chunk. No standalone local Memory-body, Memory-record, Memory-version, routing-metadata, or `CVAVERS2` chunk is emitted before it. Embedded bodies are indexed by `MemoryBodyId` against the outer completion `ChunkRef`; body resolution reads that completion chunk and selects the matching embedded body by ID. Existing local bodies may be referenced without being re-embedded. Embedded routing metadata is validated only after its referenced Memory record/body has been reconstructed, but becomes visible from the same outer completion transaction.

An external Memory reference is `string owner_id + 32-byte MemoryId`. The current routed implementation uses it for User-owned PHY Memories. Those Memories are published and synced in the PHY before the REL completion is appended, and are not REL semantic/version state. If the process fails after PHY publication but before the REL receipt, retry reuses the deterministic Memory mutation ID and accepts the existing PHY Memory only when its routed semantics match.

If a `CVAINSC5` append is interrupted, ordinary trailing-chunk recovery removes the incomplete outer REL chunk, leaving no orphan local REL body, record, routing attachment, or global-version ticket. The Episode therefore reopens as Pending and can be retried safely. Any already-synced external PHY Memory/routing attachment remains durable and is reused by that retry. A valid completed transaction reconstructs all new local Memories, their embedded routing metadata, plus the successful receipt and its external references together.

`CVAINSC4` remains decodable with the same transaction timestamp, owner-qualified external Memory references, and atomic local Memory transaction as current V5, but it predates embedded routing metadata and therefore reopens with none from that completion. `CVAINSC3` retains external Memory references but predates explicit transaction time, so its embedded versions reopen with unknown transaction timestamps. `CVAINSC2` has the same embedded local Memory transaction but no external-reference section and likewise has no transaction-time mapping. `CVAINSC1` also remains decodable; in that older format, content-addressed Memory bodies and standalone global-version tickets may precede the completion chunk. V1/V2 completions reopen with an empty external-reference list. Current processing writes only `CVAINSC5`.

The older `CVAINSA1` attempt record remains decodable so existing same-format development files can reopen, but current processing no longer emits it. Retryable failures are runtime-only and add no persistent record. A final Terminal outcome currently persists as one `CVAINSW1` record; a successful outcome persists as one compact `CVAINSC5` REL transaction, with any routed external owner publication already durable.

Optional values use a one-byte `0`/`1` presence flag followed by the encoded value when present.

## Historical semantics

Archive, Memories, Entities, Graph, and Vector Generations have independent local watermarks. Community `generation` and `memory_graph_version` are derived-state bookkeeping, not independent semantic-owner clocks. Global ordering may interleave semantic mutations; integer adjacency is never semantic ancestry. Packed matrices, Memory-Vector bindings, Archive-Vector bindings, and compatibility profiles are immutable backing objects. Memory Vectors have no local clock because their identity is immutable semantic Memory content plus compatibility profile. A published Vector Generation is the semantic association that activates one profile/population.

## Diagnostics and failure behavior

`Cva::open` / `Reliquary::open` requires Reliquary type/scope identity (or the legacy 16-byte Project form) and validates the format markers and records owned by each persisted subsystem. Current 40-byte typed files also carry the durable owner UUID; earlier 16-byte and 24-byte forms remain readable for explicit migration but have no owner ID. Graph and Entity are compatibility exceptions for older files created before those owners existed: absence of their records opens as empty owner state, and new durable writes initialize the required current records. Other unsupported development-format incompatibilities fail closed.

`Phylactery::open` requires exact typed Phylactery identity (`file_kind=2`, scope byte `0`) and rebuilds Memories, Entities, typed Graph state, optional Community snapshots/semantic names, Packed Vectors, Memory Vectors, Compatibility Profiles, Ego state, and Entity-resolution state where present. It validates semantic global-version uniqueness, Graph endpoints, Entity-resolution references, Community/name membership references, vector/profile references, absence of REL-local Memory provenance, and structural validity of any external `MemorySourceRef`. REL, legacy CVA, and invalid file-kind/scope combinations fail closed.

Container validates framing/global tickets. A truncated **final** length-prefixed chunk is treated as an interrupted append: reopen truncates the file to that chunk's starting offset and resumes from the last complete chunk boundary. Truncation of the REL/PHY header still fails closed. Concrete stores validate their own complete records. Cross-store references are validated after reconstruction in dependency order. Composition-level validation rejects a global version claimed by multiple semantic mutations.

## Defaults or precedence

Default fragments use eight turns with two-turn overlap; the exported library constants `DEFAULT_FRAGMENT_TURNS` and `DEFAULT_FRAGMENT_OVERLAP` are the single source for that default policy. Default Episode input ceiling is 32 KiB. Compatibility probe suite v1 and compatibility policy v2 are fixed by the current implementation.

## Notes

These remain development formats and may evolve before a stable external-format commitment. Filenames are indexed only in the disposable in-memory lexical index and add no persistent record. Broader persistent lexical indexing, ANN acceleration, generalized retention/vacuum, and whole-file historical restore remain future work.
